We came up with this app to help beginners get engaged in the world of development. The prevalent problem is that people find it too hard to learn to code on their own or are too scared to try. To solve this problem, we hope that this fun, easy to use game will help motivate them to learn. Hope you all have as much fun trying it out as we did making it! Thank you!
